# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating respect and courtesy to everyone.
- Being inclusive and considerate in our language and actions.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
- Enforcement Responsibilities
- Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including issue trackers, mailing lists, forums, chat platforms, and any other place where the community interacts. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. You can contact us at [illuminati0440@gmail.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1, available at [contributor-covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).
